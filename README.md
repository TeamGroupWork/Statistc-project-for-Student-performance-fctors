# Student Performance Factors â€“ Statistical Analysis

This project investigates the key factors that influence student academic performance using statistical techniques. It aims to identify patterns and correlations between variables such as study time, family background, health, and grades.

## Objective
To understand which factors most significantly impact student performance and how these insights can help improve educational outcomes.

## Dataset
We use a real-world dataset containing student demographic, social, and academic information. Common features include:
- Study time
- Absences
- Parental education
- Internet access
- School support
- Health status
- Final grades

## Tools & Techniques
- Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scipy, statsmodels)
- Statistical Methods:
  - Correlation analysis
  - Descriptive statistics
  - Linear regression
  - Hypothesis testing
- Data Visualization to reveal trends and relationships

## Key Findings
- Study time shows a strong positive correlation with grades.
- Health and absences negatively affect performance.
- Parental education and school support play moderate roles.
